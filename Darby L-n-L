Desserts will be provided, so bring your lunch or pick something up from the cafeteria. 


Join us as we welcome Bryce Mahoney, Director of The Darby Project, to tell us how his organization got started and how it positively impacts the veteran community. 

The Darby Project leads the way in helping service members transition into civilian life. And that is because Bryce has made that transition himself. 

As a former Army Ranger with the 75th Ranger Regiment, Bryce deployed to Afghanistan only weeks after 9/11. Like many of us, Bryce understands the challenges of transitioning from military life to civilian life. Bryce shares a passion for helping other veterans not lose sight of their sense of purpose while adjusting to their new lifestyle.  

Come learn how you can assist the Darby Project. Share your transition story or ideas about assisting veterans as they leave military service.
