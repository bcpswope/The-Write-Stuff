IBM Veterans BRG Lunch-n-Learn
The Darby Project and RunRangerRun event

Ten members of the BRG signed up to run, hike, or bike 565 miles during the month of February as part of the Gallant Few's Run Ranger Run,  The Darby Projects annual fundraiser. Join us as we welcome Bryce Mahoney, Director of The Darby Project, to tell us how his organization got started and how it positively impacts the veteran community.

The Darby Project leads the way in helping service members transition into civilian life. And that is because Bryce has made that transition himself. As a former Army Ranger with the 75th Ranger Regiment, Bryce deployed to Afghanistan only weeks after 9/11. Like many of us, Bryce understands the challenges of transitioning from military life to civilian life. Bryce shares a passion for helping other veterans not lose sight of their sense of purpose while adjusting to their new lifestyle.  

Come learn how you can assist the Darby Project. Share your tranition story or ideas about assisting veterans as they leave military service.



When: Monday, February 12th
Time: 12:00-1:00 pm
